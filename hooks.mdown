# Other Hook Ideas
Borrowed from CakePHP:

* beforeFilter(), executed before any controller action logic
* beforeRender(), executed after controller logic, but before the view is rendered
* afterFilter(), executed after all controller logic, including the view render. There may be no difference between afterRender() and afterFilter() unless youâ€™ve manually made a call to render() in your controller action and have included some logic after that call.


* beforeFind()
* afterFind()
* beforeValidate()
* beforeSave()
* afterSave()
* beforeDelete()
* afterDelete()

The names of these methods should be descriptive enough to let you know what they do.
