# -Indexes is optional, but prevents people from seeing all of the
# files in a directory, which adds a little extra security.

######### Rewrite Base
# 
# On some servers it's very important that you manually define 
# which folder contains Ultralite.
# 
# If you have Ultralite installed in your main directory,
# set the RewriteBase to "/", as shown in the example below:
# 
# http://example.com/
#                   ^Your Base
# RewriteBase /
# 
# Alternatively, if you have Ultralite in its own sub-folder,
# You will need to specify that sub-folder as the RewriteBase.
# 
# http://example.com/photoblog/
#                     ^Your Base
# RewriteBase /photoblog/
# 
# Please specify the RewriteBase below:
RewriteBase /ultralite

# Added Security, block people from directly accessing the 
# SQLite database, or other protected files:
RewriteRule (application/.*|\.(sqlite3|ini|db)?(\.php)?|\.htaccess)$ - [F,L]

# Clean url rewriting
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d

RewriteRule ^(.*)$ index.php?$1 [L,QSA]
