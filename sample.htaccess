######### Ultralite .htaccess Code
# Generated on: 02/09/09
# 
# Rename this file to ".htaccess" if you wish to use clean URLs.

# FollowSymLinks is required for mod_rewrite to function properly.
# -Indexes is optional, but prevents people from seeing all of the
# files in a directory, which adds a little extra security.
Options FollowSymLinks -Indexes

<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
# Enable mod_rewrite:
RewriteEngine On


######### Rewrite Base
# 
# On some servers it's very important that you manually define 
# which folder contains Ultralite.
# 
# If you have Ultralite installed in your main directory,
# set the RewriteBase to "/", as shown in the example below:
# 
# http://example.com/
#                   ^Your Base
# RewriteBase /
# 
# Alternatively, if you have Ultralite in its own sub-folder,
# You will need to specify that sub-folder as the RewriteBase.
# 
# http://example.com/photoblog/
#                     ^Your Base
# RewriteBase /photoblog/
# 
# Please specify the RewriteBase below:
RewriteBase /


# Added Security, block people from 
# directly accessing the SQLite database:
RewriteRule (\.sqlite3?(\.php)?|\.db|\.htaccess)$ - [F,L]


# If the request is for an actual file 
# or directory, don't rewrite it:
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} -f [OR]
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} -d
RewriteRule . - [L]


######### Clean URL Format Guide
# 
# /post/123/my-title/page/3
#  ^1   ^2   ^3       ^4
# 
# 1 - View mode (required)
# 		Possibilities could be: post, rss, archive, etc.
# 
# 2 - Post ID (optional)
# 		This could also be used as a search query
# 
# 3 - Extra information (optional)
# 		This can be used to store any additional data that you'd like to include in the URL.
# 		Some possibilities are the post title, or for an archive page, sub categories or tags
# 
# 4 - Current Page
# 		If you want to specify a page, other than page 1, you should append the suffix "/page/#" to your url.
# 		You can append it to any url, either short or long. 
#
